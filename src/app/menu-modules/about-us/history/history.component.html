            Meher Baba was born in the old maternity ward in the hospital, and
            the father of the nation, Mahatma, Gandhi was operated upon for

            The first Principal of the B. J. Medical College, which started with
            50 students, was Dr. B. B. Dikshit, a renowned academician and the
            quiet mastery of Dr. Bhende, discipline of Dr. Balwani have left an
            indelible imprint on the young impressionable minds of innumerable
            students, in their formative years, who in turn have imbibed these
            sterling qualities to give back the best to society. For many years
            annually 200 students are admitted for MBBS graduation and 143 for
            postgraduation. At any given time now 1700 students are on the
            campus with more than 2000 staff including 268 faculties. Presently,
            courses of MBBS, MD, MS, PhD, Diplomas, MCh (CVTS), MSc, GNM, BSc
            Nursing, DMLT, PGDMCH, and PGDGM are offered here. Along the journey
            of learning the art and science, commerce of medicine, strong values
            were inculcated, attitudes shaped friendships forged minds were
            moulded and personalities groomed to give rise to renowned
            'personalities' who carved a niche for themselves, in the world.
            While on one hand many have reached dizzying heights of success and
            excellence in their chosen profession winning international acclaim,
            on the other hand, we have some for their unforgettable contribution
            to cinema and theatre. We have among â€˜BJitesâ€™, dramatists
            trailing a blaze of glory, keen photographers clicking away, nature
            lover's trekking their way to the wild, litterateurs penning their
            thoughts in prose and poetry mountaineers climbing new heights and
            musicians rocking the stage. BJMC even finds a place in the
            political scenario with doctor politicians and astute
            administrators. The firm groundwork laid by Dr. Dikshit and his
            successor Dr. B. M. Desai, in establishing a rich tradition of
            excellent teaching, notable research and devoted service has been
            continued and built upon by successive eminent Deans, up to Dr. Ajay
            S. Chandanwale, in the present day. Their efforts to retain the good
            old values, while bringing in the new have resulted in our
            institution attaining a position of pre-eminence, rated among the
            top ten medical colleges in India. The sincerity, devotion, single
            minded love for teaching of countless teachers has rubbed off on
            successive batches of students, who endeavour to emulate them. While
            some have entered academics, the second generation teachers are
            passing on the legacy to the current generation of students while
            others are providing yoman service of relieving suffering of
            patients to society. BJMC has given various social activists to the
            society. Those who have reached the pinnacles of glory in their
            professional organisations have brought laurels and given name and
            fame to our institution. The next generations of â€˜BJitesâ€™ are
            closely following in the footsteps of their parents. Above all, Dr.
            Dikshitâ€™s path breaking research contribution to the role of
            acetylcholine in sleep and Dr. Bhende's discovery of the Bombay
            blood group have etched their names for posterity, Sassoon Hospital
            had its name in the Jablonski's Dictionary of syndromes, for the
            syndrome discovered and named after it, by Dr. Ganla and Dr. M. J.
            Narsimhan. After the centenary celebrations of Sassoon Hospital in
            1968, the staff society was born, thanks to the efforts of research
            minded academicians Dr. Deodhar, Dr. Mutalik and others to provide a
            platform for sharing and exchange of research work at Staff
            conferences. The staff society was merged with the newly formed
            Research Society to boost interdepartmental research and provide a
            forum for young researches to present their work and publish it in
            the Research Society Journal 'Medical Journal of Western India. Both
            are running in full stream and have provided a stepping board for
            young staff members and students to pursue a career in research. The
            next two decades saw the expansion of departments and extension of
            Spheres of activity Several speciality clinics were started. The
            third decade saw the bifurcation of departments Allied disciplines
            became full-fledged departments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last two decades mark the spreading of wings. Collaborative
            research through funding agencies like the ICMR and DST took off in
            a big way. Tribal Research Programme was initiated by the Government
            of Maharashtra. The Maharashtra Institute of Mental Health - an apex
            training and research institute was set up in 1991. Outreach
            services in mental health, preventive medicine, human reproduction
            research, tribal research, through national agencies like ICMR, and
            international agencies like WHO and UNICEF got underway, with the
            initiation of large scale research projects the Institutional Ethics
            Committee was born. Taking services beyond the boundaries of the
            institution the Pharmacology Department started publishing quarterly
            Drug Bulletins 'Drugs News and Views' from 1993 and has been
            conducting CMES for general practitioner. The Microbiology
            Department started surveillance services for communicable diseases.
            1996 marked the glorious Golden Jubilee of our institution, and
            plans for renovation of the college library got underway. In a few
            years the Central Library was transformed into a state of the art
            'Library Services Department.' Following the Golden Jubilee, a
            number of new facilities - diagnostic and therapeutic have been
            setup - the CT scan, Nuclear Medicine Department, Cardiac
            Catheterisation Lab, Cardiovascular Thoracic Surgery Unit, the
            Leptospirosis Diagnostic Lab among others. The Infosys Super
            speciality Building in the campus is catering to super speciality
            services for patients. In 1998, new era of collaborative
            international research started in BJMC. Dr. M. A. Phadke, then Dean,
            collaborated with Dr. Robert C. Bollinger from Johns Hopkins
            University (JHU), USA. National Institute of Health (NIH) USA funded
            the jointly made grant application. Dr. Ramesh A. Bhosale after
            training in JHU started this work with Dr. K. E. Bharucha then Head
            of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department. Six Week Extended
            Nevirapine (SWEN) study was conducted with this grant over the
            period of 2002-2007 for prevention of mother to infant transmission
            of HIV. This landmark study was published in Lancet (2008) which
            made impact leading to modification of guidelines by WHO for
            prevention of mother to infant transmission of HIV in breastfeeding
            population in resource poor areas. This gave BJMC the capability of
            international grade research. After this successful demonstration of
            research capability, NIH USA granted Clinical Trial Unit to BJMC in
            collaboration with JHU for 2008-2014. BJMC-JHU application in
            response to RFA of NIH, topped in first five amongst all
            applications from world over. Now in BJMC multiple study protocols
            of research networks of ACTG and IMPAACT are being implemented
            successfully under BJMC CTU lead by Dr. Ajay S. Chandanwale as
            Principal Investigator. Various other projects are completed by BJMC
            viz. Vanderbilt University USA-NARI-BJMC collaborative project on
            Cancer Cervix Screening in HIV under Dr. Ramesh A. Bhosale Professor
            and Head of Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, WHO
            Cardiovascular Disease surveillance project, International Clinical
            Epidemiology Network project for MDR TB surveillance, IDSP Training
            & pilot center, NACO Training Center for : MOs, Technicians &
            Counselors, etc. In year 2005, through National AIDS Control
            Organization (NACO) HIV treatment center (ART) was started giving
            treatment free of charge. Presently more than 24000 HIV infected
            patients are registered in the ART center and about 12000 are on
            free ART. This center is the second best in India and lead by Nodal
            Officer Prof. Dr. D. B. Kadam. BJMC is recognised Government TB
            treatment center having 4000 tuberculosis patients/suspects per
            year. BJMC and alumni celebrated Diamond Jubilee of BJMC in year
            2006 which gave impetus to alumni association. Government of
            Maharashtra gave the special fund for BJMC through which an 11
            storied new building with 26000 sq m built up area is presently
            being constructed.
